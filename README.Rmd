The goal of `iSEEhub` is to provide an interface to the Bioconductor
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` directly within an
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")` web-application.

The main functionality of this package is to define a custom landing page
allowing users to browse the Bioconductor `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`
and directly load objects into an `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")` web-application.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `iSEEhub` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("iSEEhub")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinrue/iSEEhub) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("kevinrue/iSEEhub")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = requireNamespace('iSEEhub')}
library("iSEEhub")
library(ExperimentHub)
ehub <- ExperimentHub()

app <- iSEEhub(ehub)

if (interactive()) {
  shiny::runApp(app, port = 1234)
}
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('iSEEhub')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __iSEEhub__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('iSEEhub')}
print(citation('iSEEhub'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `iSEEhub` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
